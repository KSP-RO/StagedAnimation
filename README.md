# StagedAnimation

This plugin adds a lightweight partmodule that, when the part it is on is staged, plays a defined animation. It's a drop-in replacement for ModuleAnimatedDecoupler except with no decoupling. The staging icon is still a decoupler though, just so you can see one.

Based on animation-playing code by Starwaster in Animated Decouplers, full credit to them for that base.
